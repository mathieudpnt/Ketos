Next version
============

We plan to include the following changes to future versions:  
  
**Version 3.0 (anticipated release: July 2022)**
    * Transfer learning module
    * Tensorflow graph computation of spectrograms
    * New neural network architectures
    
        * Sequence model
        * Similarity model (e.g. Siamese network)
        * Object-detection network (e.g. R-CNN)
    
    * Overhaul of html docs (style, structure and content)
    * Review all tutorials, and add new ones as needed
    * Publish peer-reviewed software paper about Ketos (e.g. in `JOSS <https://joss.theoj.org/>`_)

**Version 4.0  (anticipated release: TBD)**
    * Functionalities to support active learning
    * Methods to calibrate neural networks so that the output scores correspond more closely to probabilities/confidences.
    * Neural architecture search capabilities, allowing recommendation of the optimal architecture to be used for a given task.
