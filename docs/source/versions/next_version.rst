**Version 2.1.0**  
    * Add a detection module, including utility functions to build detectors from trained classifiers
    * Add a 'Building a detector' tutorial
    * Add new network architectures

**Version 3.0.0**
    * Add Neural Architecture Search capabilities, which would allow it to recommend the optimal architecture to be used in a given task.
    * Add high-level transfer learning functionalities, which will make it simple to to adapt pre-trained models to new environments and tasks.
